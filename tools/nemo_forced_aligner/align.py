"""
Align the utterances in manifest_filepath. 
Results are saved in ctm files in output_ctm_folder.

Arguments:
    manifest_filepath: filepath to the manifest of the data you want to align,
        containing 'audio_filepath' and 'text' fields.
    output_ctm_folder: the folder where output CTM files will be saved.
    model_name: string specifying a NeMo ASR model to use for generating the log-probs
        which we will use to do alignment.
        If the string ends with '.nemo', the code will treat `model_name` as a local filepath
        from which it will attempt to restore a NeMo model.
        If the string does not end with '.nemo', the code will attempt to download a model
        with name `model_name` from NGC.  
    model_downsample_factor: an int indicating the downsample factor of the ASR model, ie the ratio of input 
        timesteps to output timesteps. 
        If the ASR model is a QuartzNet model, its downsample factor is 2.
        If the ASR model is a Conformer CTC model, its downsample factor is 4.
        If the ASR model is a Citirnet model, its downsample factor is 8.
    separator: the string used to separate CTM segments.
        If the separator is “”, the CTM segments will be the tokens used by the ASR model.
        If the separator is anything else, e.g. “ “, “|” or “<new section>”, the segments will be the blocks of 
        text separated by that separator.
        Default: “ “, ie for languages such as English, the CTM segments will be words.
        Note: if the separator is not “” or “ “, it will be removed from the CTM, ie it is treated as a marker 
        which is not part of the ground truth. It will essentially be treated as a space, and any additional spaces 
        around it will be amalgamated into one, i.e. the following texts will be treated as equivalent:
        “abc|def”
        “abc |def”
        “abc| def”
        “abc | def”
    n_parts_for_ctm_id: int specifying how many of the 'parts' of the audio_filepath
        we will use (starting from the final part of the audio_filepath) to determine the 
        utt_id that will be used in the CTM files. Note also that any spaces that are present in the audio_filepath 
        will be stripped away from the utt_id, so as not to change the number of space-separated elements in the 
        CTM files.
        e.g. if audio_filepath is "/a/b/c/d/e 1.wav" and n_parts_for_ctm_id is 1 => utt_id will be "e1"
        e.g. if audio_filepath is "/a/b/c/d/e 1.wav" and n_parts_for_ctm_id is 2 => utt_id will be "d_e1"
        e.g. if audio_filepath is "/a/b/c/d/e 1.wav" and n_parts_for_ctm_id is 3 => utt_id will be "c_d_e1"
    audio_sr: int specifying the sample rate of your audio files.
    device: string specifying the device that will be used for generating log-probs and doing 
        Viterbi decoding. The string needs to be in a format recognized by torch.device()
    batch_size: int specifying batch size that will be used for generating log-probs and doing Viterbi decoding.
